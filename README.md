# Vehicle Data Classification Project

## Introduction

This repository contains code and documentation for a project aimed at classifying vehicle data into segments using various machine learning algorithms. The project objectives, data description, preprocessing steps, analysis, results, and managerial insights are documented here.

## Project Objectives
```
The main objectives of the project are:

1. Segmentation of vehicle data using unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms.
2. Identification of the appropriate number of segments or clusters.
3. Determination of segment or cluster characteristics.
```
## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data/data). It consists of 12 columns and 100,000 records, with both categorical and non-categorical variables.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing data, numerical encoding of categorical variables, outlier detection and treatment, data transformation, and scaling.

## Data Analysis

Various classification models such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) are evaluated based on accuracy, training time, memory usage, and feature importance.

## Results

The results section provides insights into model performance, including accuracy, training time, memory usage, and variable importance. Managerial insights are also provided for real-life applications of the classification models.

## Managerial Insights

Real-life managerial insights are presented for applications such as customer churn prediction, credit risk assessment, inventory optimization, sentiment analysis, and healthcare diagnosis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
